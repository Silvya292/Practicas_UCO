Created a graph with capacity = 6 and size=0
Added node with data 'A'. Graph size =1
Added node with data 'B'. Graph size =2
Added node with data 'C'. Graph size =3
Set weight of edge (A,B) to 1
Set weight of edge (B,C) to 2
Set weight of edge (B,A) to 5
Set weight of edge (C,A) to 3
Set weight of edge (C,B) to 4
Incident edges on vertex 'A' :
A -- 1 --> B
Incident edges on vertex 'B' :
B -- 5 --> A
B -- 2 --> C
Incident edges on vertex 'C' :
C -- 3 --> A
C -- 4 --> B
