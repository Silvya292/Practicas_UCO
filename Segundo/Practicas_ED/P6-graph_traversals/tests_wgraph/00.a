Created a graph with capacity = 3 and size=0
Added node with data 'A'. Graph size =1
Added node with data 'B'. Graph size =2
Added node with data 'C'. Graph size =3
Set weight of edge (A,B) to 1
Set weight of edge (B,C) to 2
Set weight of edge (C,A) to 3
Set weight of edge (C,B) to 4
Graph's edges:
A -- 1 --> B
B -- 2 --> C
C -- 3 --> A
C -- 4 --> B
