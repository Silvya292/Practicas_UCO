Created a graph with capacity = 6 and size=0
Added node with data 'A'. Graph size =1
Added node with data 'B'. Graph size =2
Added node with data 'C'. Graph size =3
Set weight of edge (A,B) to 1
Set weight of edge (B,C) to 2
Set weight of edge (B,A) to 5
Set weight of edge (C,A) to 3
Set weight of edge (C,B) to 4
Edge 'A' to 'B' has weight=1
Edge 'B' to 'A' has weight=5
Edge 'B' to 'C' has weight=2
Edge 'C' to 'A' has weight=3
Edge 'C' to 'B' has weight=4
